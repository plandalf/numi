# Numi: Billing Without Boundaries

<!-- SUCCESS Framework Principles:
- SIMPLE: Easy setup, visual editor, no technical skills needed
- UNEXPECTED: $25/month vs $300+ competitors, 15-minute setup vs 2-week implementation, integrates with everything vs closed ecosystems
- CONCRETE: Time savings (8 hours/week → 30 minutes), cost savings ($270/month), setup time (15 minutes vs 2 weeks), instant vs delayed payments, unlimited integrations
- CREDIBLE: Real business scenarios, specific platform comparisons, logical process improvements, actual integration examples
- EMOTIONAL: Freedom from platform lock-in, pride in professional brand experience, relief from expensive closed systems
- STORIES: Sarah (music teacher), Becca (magazine publisher), other customer success stories
-->

<!-- ICP: Small to medium business owners ($10K-$500K annual revenue) running service businesses, content/media companies, course creators, consultants, and local businesses. They're currently using expensive platforms like Kajabi or doing manual billing processes. They want professional checkout experiences without the complexity or cost of enterprise solutions. Key personas: Becca (regional magazine owner, frustrated with Kajabi's $300/month cost and inflexibility) and Sarah (music teacher manually sending Stripe links days after students try to sign up). -->

## Build a Great Business with Billing That Actually Works

**You're creating something amazing.** Your customers love what you do. But when it comes time to pay, the experience doesn't match your quality.

Maybe you're **manually sending payment links** days after customers try to buy. Maybe you're **trapped in expensive closed platforms** like Kajabi that cost $300+ monthly but won't integrate with your existing tools. Maybe your **billing system fights against your workflow** instead of working with it.

**The opportunity?** Professional billing that integrates with everything you already use. Instant payments that fit seamlessly into any workflow. Hours back in your week to focus on what you love.

**What if you could add professional checkout to any process, anywhere?**

## Meet Business Owners Who Made the Switch

### Sarah: "From 2-Day Delays to Instant Payment in My Existing Workflow"

Sarah teaches music classes in Austin. Students would fill out her signup form, then she'd manually send them a Stripe payment link 2-3 days later.

*"I was losing students to my own slow process. Now with Numi, they pay instantly when they're excited to sign up. I went from spending 8 hours a week on admin to just 30 minutes. Best part? It works with my existing scheduling software."*

### Becca: "Cut Costs by $270/Month and Finally Got the Integrations I Needed"

Becca publishes a regional magazine with subscription and advertising revenue. Kajabi's closed ecosystem couldn't connect with her design tools, CRM, or accounting software.

*"I was paying $300/month but still doing everything manually because Kajabi wouldn't talk to my other tools. With Numi, I built exactly what I needed for $25/month and it integrates with everything - Mailchimp, QuickBooks, even my custom spreadsheets."*

### The Pattern: Great Businesses Need Flexible Billing

Your business uses multiple tools that work together. **Your billing should connect everything, not create another silo.**

## Questions? We've Got Answers

### **"How is this different from Stripe Checkout?"**
Stripe Checkout is basic and standalone. Numi gives you branded checkout experiences plus deep integrations with your existing business tools. Your billing becomes part of your workflow, not separate from it.

### **"What if I'm already using Kajabi or Teachable?"**
Most customers switch to Numi in under an hour and finally get the integrations they've been wanting. You'll save $200-300/month while connecting to tools those platforms don't support.

### **"Can it really integrate with everything?"**
Yes - through our API, webhooks, Zapier connections, and direct integrations. If a tool can receive data, Numi can send it. We've never met a workflow we couldn't support.

### **"What about my existing Stripe account?"**
You keep using your own Stripe account. Numi just adds beautiful checkout pages and powerful integrations that make Stripe work better with your entire business ecosystem.

### **"What if I need a custom integration?"**
Our API is completely open, and our team helps with custom integrations. We love connecting to new tools!
